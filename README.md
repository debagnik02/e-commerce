Building an e-commerce web application to learn MERN stack.

This is an E-Commerce Web Application that I built taking reference from Brad Traversy. The code is self-written but references are taken from his code.

It is a fully functional E-Commerce Application with Payment Gateway, Auth Integration, and all routes used follow REST. The website uses admin and guest functionality for handling all listings and orders.
